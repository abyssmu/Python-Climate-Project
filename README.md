# Climate-Project
A python project meant to analyze local historical weather data and determine how climate change has effected local ecosystems.

The data is collected by year and analyzed. Input a start year and end year and run.

The project is in its infancy and currently just collects temperature hi's and low's and snowfall data. From this data, it creates a Pandas dataframe and creates an excel workbook. Inside the workbook, it creates seperate worksheets for each year, and plots the annual data on a line graph.
